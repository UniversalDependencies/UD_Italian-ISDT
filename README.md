# Summary

The Italian corpus annotated according to the UD annotation scheme was obtained by conversion from ISDT (Italian Stanford Dependency Treebank), released for the dependency parsing shared task of Evalita-2014 (Bosco et al. 2014).

# Introduction

ISDT is a resource annotated according to the Stanford dependencies scheme (de Marneffe et al. 2008, 2013a, 2013b, 2014), obtained through a semi-automatic conversion process starting from MIDT (the Merged Italian Dependency Treebank). MIDT, in turn, is the result of a previous effort in the direction of improving interoperability of data sets available for Italian by harmonizing and merging two existing dependency–based resources, differing both in corpus composition and adopted annotation schemes, namely:

* TUT, the Turin University Treebank (Bosco et al. 2000);
* ISST-TANL, first released as ISST-CoNLL for the CoNLL-2007 shared task (Montemagni, Simi 2007), which was developed as a joint effort by the Istituto di Linguistica Computazionale (ILC–CNR) and the University of Pisa and originating from the Italian Syntactic–Semantic Treebank (ISST, Montemagni et al. 2003).

The details of the harmonization and conversion process leading to MIDT are discussed in (Bosco, Montemagni, Simi, 2012). The Stanford annotation scheme, obtained from an enriched version of MIDT, was adapted to the specificity of the Italian language. We refer to (Bosco, Montemagni, Simi, 2013 and 2014) for a discussion.

# Acknowledgments

We wish to thank all of the contributors to the original annotation efforts, as well as the supporting organizations, i.e. the Institute for Computational Linguistics "A. Zampolli", the University of Pisa, and the University of Torino. Thanks go to Chiara Alzetta and Giulia Venturi for the good work in defining the error detection methodology and the manual revision / correction of automatically identified errors in Version 2.1.
